#### Search for Windows that doesn't suck

Development is currently on hold due to other projects taking priority. Many, many issues still need to be ironed out. In the meantime, I recommend checking out [PowerToys Run](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/run) as an alternative.

The current beta [can be downloaded here](https://github.com/luketimothyjones/Illumine/releases/download/v0.0.6-beta/Illumine.Setup.exe).

Controls:

- ESC to close results window.

- CTRL + WIN + Period (full-stop) to focus the searchbar above other windows, otherwise it lives on your desktop.

  - The keybind can be changed by right-clicking the searchbar.

- Double-click to open files.

NOTE:  

Illumine requires the non-lite version of [Everything 64-bit](https://www.voidtools.com/downloads/) for search indexing. If it is not already installed, the setup will install it for you.
